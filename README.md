# ☠️ Introduction

**Marrow is an open-source library built to turn your robot from a deterministic machine into an intelligent powerhouse.**

With Marrow, instead of simply following pre-programmed instructions, your robot can react and adapt in real-time to what's happening on the field. Marrow also provides powerful developer tools that simplify setup, testing, and managing complex robot logic - so you can spend less time debugging and more time building intelligent behaviors.
